# Linkedlist and it's applications

### Linkedlist
LinkedList is a linear data structure that has useful benefits over the array. LinkedList is a dynamically scalable data store, unlike the array this store doesn’t have a predefined length. Items are inserted and removed in runtime.
### Applications
LinkedList is applicable in various use cases but here I have listed two of these:
- Stack
- Queue
#### Stack
Stack is a widely used data store in digital computation that work upon `LIFO`. The `LIFO` principle signifies the last inserted item to be popped first. Stack has only one end to insert or remove items from the store. The stack store is used to manage the state for function calls. A stack can be implemented use LinkedList.
#### Queue
The queue is another extensively used data store that works upon FIFO principle. FIFO implies processing items on first come first serve orders. Queue uses two terminals one to insert new items other to read items. LinkedList can react as a queue with some alteration.
### Implementation
I have used `OOP` for this proposal. `OOP` is a very powerful paradigm in developing real-world entities that improve reusability. `Stack` and `queue` are children of LinkedList and can be implemented using the basic features available in LinkedList. For that inheritance is a very useful concept of  `OOP`. Both `stack` and `queue` are derived and inherit the basic functionality of LinkedList. Then specific behavior are altered through polymorphism in the respective entity.
