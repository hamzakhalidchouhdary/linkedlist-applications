# Linkedlist and it's applications

### Linkedlist
Linkedlist is an linear data structure that useful benefit over array. Linkedlist is dynamically scalable data store unlike the array this store doesnâ€™t have predefined length. Items easily be inserted and removed in runtime.
### Applications
Linkedlist is applicable in various usecases but here I have listed two of these:
- Stack
- Queue
#### Stack
Stack is widely use data store in digital computation that work upon `LIFO`. `LIFO` principle signify last inserted item to be poped first. Stack has only one end to insert or remove items from the store. Stack store is used to manage state for function calls. Stack can implemented use linkedlist.
#### Queue
Queue is another extensively used data store that work upon `FIFO` principle. `FIFO` implies to process items in first come first serve order. Queue uses two terminals one to insert new items other to read item. Linkedlist can be react as queue with some alteration.
### Implementation
I have used OOP for this proposal. OOP is a very powerful paradigm in developing real-world entities that improve reusability. Stack and queue are children of LinkedList and can be implemented using the basic features available in LinkedList. For that inheritance is a very useful concept of OOP. Both stack and queue are derived and inherit the basic functionality of LinkedList. Then alter the specific behavior through polymorphism in the respective entity.
